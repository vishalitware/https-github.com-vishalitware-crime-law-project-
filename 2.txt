On the the basis of material that was collected by the petitioner during the investigation the High Court has come to the conclusion that no case under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code,1860 has been made. These findings do not require any interference. However, we find that in Paragraphs 17 of the impugned judgment the High Court has also mentioned that if the Investigating Agency, on the basis of material produced before the Agency and on the basis of allegations made in the complaint, is satisfied as regards existence of grounds or circumstances necessitating further inquiry or inquiry in respect of any such offences, it would be permissible for the Investigating Agency to investigate into the matter and the instant decision shall not be treated as bar for taking steps in accordance with law.In view of the aforesaid observations, we clarify that it would be open to the petitioner to make further investigation if it finds expedient to do so. The result would be though the proceedings arising out of the said FIR are quashed qua the
respondent, the FIR would still be treated as alive for the further
investigation, if any.The Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly.Pending application(s), if any, shall be disposed of
accordingly.
