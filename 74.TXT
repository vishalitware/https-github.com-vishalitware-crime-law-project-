The judgment in Pooran Mals case (supra) only lays down that the evidence collected as a result of
illegal search or seizure, could be used as evidence in proceedings against the party under the
Income Tax Act. The judgment cannot be interpreted to lay down that a contraband seized as a
result of illegal search or seizure, can be used to fasten that liability of unlawful possession of the
contraband on the person from whom the contraband had allegedly been seized in an illegal
manner. Unlawful possession of the contraband is the sine qua non for conviction under the NDPS
Act and that factor has to be established by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. Indeed the
seized contraband is evidence but in the absence of proof of possession of the same, an accused
cannot be held guilty under the NDPS Act.
