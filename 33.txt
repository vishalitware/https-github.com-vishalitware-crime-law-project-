We find no merit in the appeal and the same is liable to be dismissed. However, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the respondent Nos.7 to 9 strenuously urged before us to take into consideration the compromise which
was filed before the High Court. It is submitted that fraud was committed before the High Court to obtain the
rendered decision. It is, however, admitted by the learned counsel appearing for the said respondents that a
civil suit had been filed regarding the fraud which had allegedly been played. There is a dispute with respect to
the fact as to whether the said civil suit is pending, or has been decided. Be that as it may. It is also
submitted by Mr. V.V. Giri, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no.1, that two special
leave petitions had been filed by respondent Nos.7 & 8.One of those SLPs had been dismissed on the ground of
limitation while the other SLP was dismissed as withdrawn. Thus in the aforesaid factual situation particularly
in the absence of cross objections having been filed by the said respondents in this appeal, we cannot permit
them to raise the aforesaid question of fraud in the appeal. It was also submitted that certain fraudulent
affidavit have been filed in this Court. The facts have been disputed in the case. Thus, in the aforesaid peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case, we are not inclined to entertain the application, filed under Section 340 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.), by the said respondents. The applications are also dismissed. No costs.
