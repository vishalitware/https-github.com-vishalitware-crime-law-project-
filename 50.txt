Learned counsel for the Union of India has handed over a status report. Unfortunately, on going through the status report, it is found to be more in the nature of comments rather than a
status report. We expect the Union of India to file a proper detailed status report rather than comments on the orders passed by this Court.
The Learned Amicus and learned counsel for the petitioner have concluded their submissions with regard to Proposal 12(b) and Proposal 13.
The matter may now be listed on 08.01.2018 at 2.00 pm for submissions on behalf of learned counsel for the intermediaries with regard to Proposal 12(b) and Proposal 13.
It is stated by Col. R. Bala, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Union of India that a portal has been prepared for making complaints by citizens with regard to issues pertaining to
child sexual abuse, child pornography and rape / gang rape videos. Learned counsel for the Union of India says that the portal will be ready within a month. He further says that standard
operating procedures are being prepared for use of the portal. Learned counsel for the petitioner says that the portal should be given adequate publicity so that people can make complaints.
She says that there should also be a provision for making a complaint anonymously. Col. R. Bala, learned counsel says that he will advise the Union of India accordingly.
The matter has been pending for quite some time and we find from the affidavit filed by the CBI on 08.10.2015 that steps are being taken to enable complaints being filed through a portal. It
is high time that the Union of India gets the portal ready and available to the public at large. Therefore, we direct that the Union of India to have the
portal ready on or before 10.01.2018. We would like the report to be given on the next date of hearing i.e. 08.01.2018 with regard to the progress made. It is also made clear that on the next date of hearing also
the proceedings will be held in-camera.
