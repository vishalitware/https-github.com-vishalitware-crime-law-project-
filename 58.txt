Leave granted.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties. The High Court by the impugned order has quashed the criminal proceedings in exercise of power under Section 482
Cr.P.C. without even noticing the complainant and without examining the materials fully as to at what stage the investigation itself has proceeded. To say the least, the
High Court was wholly unjustified in setting aside a criminal proceeding where the allegations make out the offence under Section 306/34 IPC. Since the complainant has not been
noticed in the present proceeding and even the counsel for the parties are not in a position to tell us as to what is the stage of investigation, we think it appropriate to set aside
the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court for redisposal of the application by giving opportunities of hearing to all parties concerned and bearing
in mind the law laid down by this Court as to in what circumstances, the Court would be justified in quashing a criminal proceeding in exercise of power under Section 482
Cr.P.C. which, undoubtedly, has to be exercised sparingly. The Appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
