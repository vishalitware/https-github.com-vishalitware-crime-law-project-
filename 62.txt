Mr. Jaspal Singh, learned senior counsel submits that
petitioner is not interested now in urging the question whether
a co-accused has a right to cross-examine a person to whom
pardon is tendered during the proceedings for tendering such
pardon. Learned senior counsel submits that he wants to urge

this stage as the stage for raising such a contention would
arise only if any person is examined in the court of special

petitioner to raise such contention, if he feels that such
contention is necessary, we dispose of this Special Leave
Petition with the above observations.
