Leave granted.
The accused is in appeal against the order of the High
Court interfering with an order of discharge recorded by the
learned Special Judge. The order of the Special Judge
unequivocally indicates that there is no material on the basis
of which, even remotely, a charge under Section 120-B, I.P.C.
can be made against the accused C.L. Raina and accordingly
discharged him. The High Court, without even considering the
conclusion of the learned Special Judge, set aside that order.
In this Court, on being requested, the learned public
prosecutor appearing for the State of Jammu & Kashmir, was not
in a position to point out any of the particular statement in
the course of investigation on the basis of which even a prima
facie case can be said to have been established against the
accused C.L. Raina so that he would be called upon to face
the charge in trial. In that view of the matter, we have no

hesitation to come to the conclusion that the High Court was
wholly in error in interfering with the order of discharge
passed by the learned Special Judge. We, therefore, set aside
the impugned order of the High Court and allow this appeal.
