The petition has been preferred against order dated 6.6.2014 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, in Criminal Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.9914/2014. A prayer was made in the writ petition for quashing of the First Information Report (FIR), registered under Sections 406, 420, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C.; and investigation was pending. However, there are subsequent developments and charge-sheet has been filed. In facts and circumstances, this Court on 16.6.2014 issued notice and directed petitioners not to be arrested,subject to the condition that they would participate in the investigation.It is not in dispute that pursuant to the order passed by this Court on 23.6.2014, the petitioners had joined the investigation and charge-sheet has been filed.
In view of the subsequent developments, it is open to the petitioners to seek discharge, as certain material cannot be scanned by us. Hence, we are not inclined to interfere with the FIR and quash the same. The amount which had been deposited by the petitioners vide this Court's order dated 13.4.2015, is permitted to be withdrawn by the petitioners, along with the interest, if any, accrued thereon. In the circumstances, as charge-sheet has been filed,petitioners have to surrender and seek regular bail. Let them surrender within two months from today, they shall not be arrested till bail application is decided within aforesaid period. In case bail application is filed by the petitioners, the same may be decided expeditiously. Accordingly, the special leave petition is disposed of along with all the pending applications.
