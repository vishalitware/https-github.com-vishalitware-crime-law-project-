learned counsel for the parties, the abovesaid order is
recalled and the substituted order shall read thus :-
“It is submitted by Ms. Shobha, learned counsel appearing
for the petitioner that during the pendency of this special
leave petition, charge-sheet has been filed but the
investigating agency has not investigated with regard to the
statement made by the petitioner on 06.08.2014. The
complainant applied for further investigation before the
concerned court which had so directed. The
respondents-accused persons being aggrieved with the same
2
preferred a revision before the Sessions Judge who declined to
interfere with the said order. The application under Section
482 Cr.P.C. filed before the High Court is pending.
In view of the aforesaid, we do not intend to say
anything on the investigation as the same shall be dealt with
in accordance with law. We further observe that if the
direction for investigation is sustained by the High Court,
the investigating agency must investigate into the aspects as
per the order. We are sure the High Court while dealing with
petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. shall address every
aspect that is agitated before it including the issue of
stridhan.
With the above observations, the special leave petition
is disposed.”
