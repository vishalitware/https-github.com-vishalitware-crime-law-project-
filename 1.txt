On a suit filed by the appellant there was a decree which was passed against one Libra Distributing Company Private Limited and its guarantors including respondent No. 1. The judgment debtors filed an appeal before the High Court. During the pendency of the appeal and at the time of the hearing the High Court passed the following order "The Mananging Director of the Canara Bank is directed to appear before the Court on 17.12.1999 in the light of the deliberate and wilful fraud has been played upon the court by filling up of a form, knowing it is a fraudulent for the
purpose of getting a decree. The Bank must know the fact that the court cannot be taken as a ride and forged document cannot find a place in a proceeding initiated especially by a Nationalised Bank. Before directing, initiation of the proceeding, this Court feels it necessary to bring it to the notice of the Managing Director that fraud is played upon the court inviting the proceeding under Sections 192 and 210 of IPC. We are constrained to note that without deciding the appeal and giving a  finding, if the Court was so inclined, that a particular document had been fraudulently prepared, the Court could not have passed the impugned order. As of now, the decision of the trial court has not been set aside. If the appeal of the appellants therein was allowed and a finding given in the manner indicated above only then the Court would have jurisdiction to initiate proceedings in accordance with law. The impugned order is neither legal nor justified. The appeal is allowed and the impugned order of the High Court is set aside. No costs.
