These special leave petitions have been preferred against the order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Aurangabad Bench, in Crime Application NO(s).4036 of 2013 and 4010 of 2013 dated 25th
February, 2015 in and by which the High Court has cancelled the anticipatory bail granted to the petitioners for the offences punishable under Section 420, 467, 468, 471, 409, 477-C, 431 read
with Section 34 I.P.C. When the special leave petitions came up for hearing on 12th March, 2015 and 13th April, 2015, this court has granted stay of the
operation of the impugned order dated 25th February, 2015. Mr. Dilip Annasaheb Taur, learned counsel appearing for the second respondent-complainant, has submitted that the Sessions
Court has committed error in granting anticipatory bail to the petitioners and the High Court has rightly cancelled the same. Learned counsel further submitted that there is a huge amount of
public money involved in the scam and, therefore, the petitioners are to be directed to deposit alleged amount of misappropriation. We have heard learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr.
Nachiketa Joshi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent- State. This Court has stayed the operation of the impugned order of the High Court way back on 12th March, 2015 and 13th April, 2015.
After passage of three years at this distant point of time, we are not inclined to go into the merits of the contentions advanced by learned counsel for the petitioners. Suffice to note that the
parties are at liberty to raise all the contentions at the time of the trial. The special leave petitions are accordingly disposed of. The petitioners shall cooperate with further investigation, if
any, and also cooperate in expediting the trial. Pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of.
